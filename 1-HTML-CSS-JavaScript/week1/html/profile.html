            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I was born in Fontana, California
                </li>
                <li>
                     I currently live in Fairmont, Minnesota
                </li>
                <li>
                    The best job I have ever had was working as an usher at a movie theater. The perks were free drinks, all you can eat popcorn and free movies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My ideal dream job is a job that <em>heavily involves programming, creative thinking and problem-solving</em>. Something that does not get boring and brings challenge to the day-to-day operations.
